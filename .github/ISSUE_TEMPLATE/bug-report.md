To report a bug or problem with the plugin, follow the steps below:

1.) Please put your Minecraft Version and your issue in the title.
Example: 1.16.3 | Getting “Initializing Legacy Material Support."

2.) Explain clearly and specifically what the problem is.
Example: When a player uses /color, the console displays “Initializing Legacy Material Support," and the player waits about five seconds before the menu finally opens. I've already checked to make sure I'm using material names for the version my server is on. Am I doing something wrong?

3.) If needed, upload your UltraColor folder and any errors in a site like pastebin.com.
How to upload your folder?
a) For Windows, right-click the folder and select "Send To -> Compressed (zip folder)". For macOS right-click and select "Compress".
b) Then simply drag and drop the ZIP file into the issue field.

Thank you. Please remove this text and write your actual issue below.
